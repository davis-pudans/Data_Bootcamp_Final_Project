Davis Pudans

## Description

Although there has been a persistent call for gender diversity and inclusivenes in mainstream cinema, reality shows that not much has changed in the last decade. My project is focused on analysis of most popular mainstream cinema and the female representation in the lead actor and filmaker roles.

The goal of the project is to gather insights of the respective data and visually represent them.
